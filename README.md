## Resources

  - Takeaways:
    1. Read articles, papers, books, etc and place links to them in a text file. For the chosen topic answer questions such as: "What seems interesting here and what doesn't?", "What are the open questions so far?", "What is the context surrounding the topic are?".
    2. Create a folder with every article, paper, book-snippet, etc. that you plan to use. It will set the research scene for what you're writing.
    3. Create an initial outline for the final document. What sections would it comprise of?
    4. More research to support the written outline. Your goal is to know something about the field before you can write a good outline, but you need to have an outline before you understand what else you need to know about the field.
    5. Make a separate directory for each point in the outline and another directory for anything that does not fit into any of the points. For a big writing piece it is good to have at least 30 papers and/or articles.
    6. Commit to writing or doing research every day for a minimum of 4 hours.
    7. As you write when you come across something that you are not sure about / don't know enough about, consult resources from "5.".

  - Takeaways:
    1. It has to come from you. You have to have genuine interest in the topic you're writing about. But you also have to be sure that your audience will also find your topic and ideas interesting.
    2. You have to have an element of marketing and publicity. How are other people going to react? Would this resonate with them? Are you clear enough on what your ideas are?
    3. Have a good structure. Don't get lost in your ideas.
    4. Use flashcards to write down your idea so you can structure them more easily. Put a theme, title. Then you can begin to see the big picture and structure the content.
    5. Remain open to changing your ideas and beliefs are you research and write.
    6. Be in an environment that promotes focus, clarity, and a state of flow.

  - Takeaways:
    1. Create an outline of the article.
    2. Breaking the ceil. Do a happy hour writing session. At the end of a work day relatively early in the week, when you feel relaxed try to get started. Pull more sources and ideally write the first paragraph.
    3. Do a morning writing session on Thursday and/or Friday. Try to get half of the article done.
    4. Sunday morning session. Try to finish the article.
    5. Polishing session on the following Monday or Tuesday morning.
